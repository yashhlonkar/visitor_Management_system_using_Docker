This is a php app for visitor management that allows our security personnel's to document information of visitors in the system. We are security service provider for a telecom company named Sycatel.

The app allows us to document visitor/customer information such as Name, Mobile No., email, contact person name, visit reason that's a list of options such as purchasing, enquiry, dispute, meeting, presentation, others. and time stamp auto captured.

These detail are saved in MySQL.

The app has a separate page for new visitor entry, and fetch pages for all entries and lastly another fetch entry based on visit reason.

This project has to be delivered using a containerized approach and we will be using docker compose for image building and running the application.
